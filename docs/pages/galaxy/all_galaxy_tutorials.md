# Short Introduction to Galaxy

We will follow this short introduction to galaxy ( let's try to follow our )

A funny way to look at the quality of your data is to switch these ASCII characters to emoji.
We can look at this using the tool FASTQE ( FastQ + Emoji) (https://fastqe.com/)

# Quality Control Tutorial :
Let's try to do this, with the same dataset. 
Take the time to look at all the plots that are rendered when doing fastQC. ()
Trim multidatasets ->  MultiQC

# Taxonomic Profiling and Visualization of Metagenomic Data
This tutorial uses the same data as we saw in the presentation (Cuatro Ciénegas).
We use Kraken2, which is a fast and comprehensive taxonomic profiling.
Assembly started at 4pm
BUT only as good as the reference inside the dataset.

## Community alpha and beta diversity 
We use the output from Bracken to Calculate alpha and β diversity from microbiome taxonomic data.
We use Krakentools 
https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/microbiome/tutorials/diversity/tutorial.html#prepare-galaxy-and-data

# Phylogenetic placement
Explain the difference with the previous analysis, the difference with this other taxonomic profiling.
assigns taxonomy to bins, and compare the results with Kraken results.
## Assembly 
	Why should genomic data be assembled?
What is the difference between reads and contigs?
How can we assemble a metagenome?

Adapt this training with the data from Cuatro Ciénegas.
